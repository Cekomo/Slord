Swipe the letter through X-axis or Y-axis to form the word. The next letter that will be swiped can be just rigth or just below of the previous letter. The more swiping the letters the less point the player will win from the level when the word is matched. Note that, taking hint and resetting level costs 75 point (level reset decrease 75 point from total point).

When the word is correctly formed, you can press right-bottom button to level up.

# Bugs
Hint mechanism sometimes works incorrectly, especially when the needed letters are kept away from table.
