Swipe the letter through X-axis or Y-axis to form the word. The next letter that will be swiped can be just rigth or just below of the previous letter.

When the word is corectly formed, you can press right-bottom button to level up.

# Bugs
- Sometimes the word does not place the intended tile but the previous one after sliding it. (Not a high priority)
- Especially there is a required letter inside matched word, the algorithm may not understand the correct word. Try to keep away the surplus letters that the word includes.
